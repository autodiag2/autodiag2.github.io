  <h2>Simulating a car from your Android phone</h2>

  <p>
    You can simulate a car directly from your Android phone using the
    ELM327SimAndroid application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Download the application from
    <a href="https://github.com/autodiag2/ELM327SimAndroid/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      GitHub releases
    </a>
    and install it on your device.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once installed, start the simulator. The application runs a virtual
    ELM327 interface on your phone, emulating a vehicle ECU and standard
    OBD-II responses.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can then connect your preferred diagnostic tool to the simulator,
    exactly as if you were connected to a real car.
    For example, you can use
    <a href="https://github.com/fr3ts0n/AndrOBD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      AndrOBD
    </a>,
    an Android OBD diagnostic application compatible with ELM327 devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    This setup is useful for testing diagnostic applications, developing
    scantools, or experimenting with OBD-II protocols without requiring
    physical vehicle hardware.
